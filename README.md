>A minimal-footprint application that does nothing. Seriously.

## Background

Windowless Executable was once created in frustration over a lack of ways to set one's status in Steam. While most would do the logical thing and, y'know, use IE or Notepad or something as a program they run in the background, we programmers see an innate need to over-complicate everything for little benefit. So, we here at Windowless Executable Co. are proud to bring you Windowless Executable **2**, the latest iteration in applications without windows.

### What is Windowless Executable 2?

Windowless Executable 2 is the next generation of applications that do nothing and have no windows. While its younger brother Windowless-Executable was small and basic, WE2 has truly revolutionized the modern windowless-application field. Built with C# and WinForms, WE2 is guaranteed to follow enterprise-level standards for Windows application development. No more silly primitive C API for Windows! No, instead WE2 opts for the more elegant solution of creating a tray icon that sits in the background, truly revolutionizing the user's ability to **close the application**. While W-E had its shortcomings in closing, we here at WEC believe wholeheartedly that WE2 will live up to every user's expectations when it comes to being able to close the software with ease!

## Install

Installing WE2 is a simple case of placing it wherever you want! Just grab yourself a build, drop it in a directory, and you're good to go! From there, you can add it as a shortcut in Steam, add it to your games list in Discord... The possibilities are endless!

## Usage

Just run the application through your manner of choice. To close WE2, just right click on the tray icon and click "Exit." It couldn't be easier!
